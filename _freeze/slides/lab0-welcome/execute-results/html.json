Before you need help!\n\n\n## Beginnings\n\nWhile this is not a computing class, computers are the workhorse of Bayesian statistics and we will use R to both enhance understanding of fundamental course material as well as to implement inference machinery to answer questions about real data sets.\n\n## Set up RStudio\n\n### Option 1 (easiest): RStudio container\n\n- Go to [https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers](https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers) and login with your Duke NetID and Password.\n- Click `RStudio` to log into the Docker container. You should now see the RStudio environment.\n\nIf you haven't previously done so, you will need to reserve a container for `RStudio` first.\n\n\n## Set up RStudio\n\n### Option 2 (recommended): RStudio on your computer\n\n- Download `R` from [http://www.r-project.org/](http://www.r-project.org/).\n\n- Download RStudio, the popular IDE for R, from [https://posit.co/downloads/](https://posit.co/downloads/).\n\n- (optionally) download Quarto from [https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)\n\n## Getting started\n\nClick [here](/labs/lab0.html) to go through a series of exercises that cover essential skills needed to succeed in this course. You can also find a link to \"lab 0\" by clicking on \"Hello R\" from the [course schedule](/index.html) under \"Assignment\".\n\n",
